# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*War is a costly and ultimately inefficient means to address disputes. So why does it happen?*

### War is Fortunately Still a Rare Event

We care about war because of its costs, but most countries are at peace most of the time.

### The American Case

Consider the case of the United States and American deaths from:

- 9/11: 2,996
- Terrorism: around a dozen per year (recent spikes in Orlando, San Bernardino)
- Iraq War: 4,493
- Murder, average year: 16,121
- Car accidents, average year: 33,804
- Accidental falls, average year: 30,208
- Diabetes as underlying condition, 2015: 79,535

```

<!-- ![Percentage of States Involved in Interstate War (Figure 3.1)](figure31.png) -->

### Defining our Terms

Let's be clear with our terms:

- *War*: Sustained combats between at least two participants that meets a miminum severity threshold.
    - Practically: 1,000 battle-related deaths per year (excluding civilian casualties).
- *Interstate*: a subset of war between at least two state system members.
- *State*: commonly a country, but with some caveats 
    - e.g. recognition, population size

```

### Wars Over Other Issues

Other issues, by contrast, are not as war-prone but can still lead to war.

- Composition of another side's regime (Iraq War, Vietnam War)
- Trade (e.g. Anglo-Dutch War)
- Various other policy concerns
    - Treatment of co-ethnics has come up recently (hello, Russia...)
    
# Bargaining and War
### War as Failed Bargain

However, it's not as simple as saying "states fight wars over stuff." *Wars are failed bargains.*

- States have numerous issues among them they try to resolve.
- They may use threats of force to influence bargaining.
- If bargaining fails, states, per our conceptual thinking, resort to war.
    
### A Simple Model of Crisis Bargaining

To that end, we devise a simple theoretical model of crisis bargaining.

- There are two players (A and B).
- A makes an offer (0 $< x <$ 1) that B accepts or rejects.
    - If B accepts, A gets $1 - x$ and B gets $x$.
    - If B rejects, A and B fight a war.

### A Simple Model of Crisis Bargaining

The war's outcome is determined by Nature (*N*)

- In game theory, Nature is a preference-less robotic actor that assigns outcomes based on probability.
- If (A or B) wins, (A or B) gets all the good in question minus the cost of fighting a war ($1 - k$)
    - Assume: $k > 0$
    - Costs could obviously be asymmetrical (e.g. $k_A$, $k_B$), but it won't change much about this illustration.
- The loser gets none of the good and eats the war cost too ($-k$).

We assume minimal offers that equal the utility of war induce a pre-war bargain.

### A Simple Model of Crisis Bargaining

Here's a simple visual representation of what we're talking about.

### Solving This Game

How do we solve this game? How do A and B avoid a war they do not want to fight?

- The way to solve extensive form (i.e. "tree") games like this is **backwards induction**.
- Players play games ex ante (calculating payoffs from the beginning)
rather than ex post (i.e. hindsight).
- They must anticipate what their choices to begin games might do as
the game unfolds.

In short, we can solve a game by starting at the end and working
back to the beginning.

### Solving This Game

For our purpose, we need to get rid of Nature.

- Nature  doesn't have preferences and doesn't "move." It just assigns outcomes.
- Here, it simulates what would happen if B rejected A's demand.

We can calculate what would happen if Nature moved by calculating the expected utility of war for A and B.

### Expected Utility for A of the War

\begin{eqnarray}
EU(\textrm{A} | \textrm{B Rejects Demand)} &=& (1 - p)(1 - k) + p(-k)   \nonumber \\
   &=& 1 - k - p + pk - pk \nonumber \\
   &=& 1 - p - k \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


### Expected Utility for B of the War

\begin{eqnarray}
EU(\textrm{B} | \textrm{B Rejects Demand)} &=& (1 - p)(-k) + p(1 - k)   \nonumber \\
   &=& -k + pk + p - pk \nonumber \\
   &=& p - k \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

### The Game Tree, with Nature Removed

![](crisis-bargaining-no-nature.png)

### Solving This Game

Now, continuing the backward induction, we focus on B.

- B ends the game with the decision to accept or reject.
- B does not need to look ahead, per se. It's now evaluating whether it maximizes its utility by accepting or rejecting a deal.

### Solving This Game

Formally, B rejects when $p - k > x$.

- It accepts when $x \ge p - k$.
- Notice A has a "first-mover advantage" in this game.
    - This allows it to offer the bare minimum to induce B to accept.
    - It would not offer anymore than necessary because that drives down A's utility.

We say A's offer of $x = p - k$ is a minimal one for B to accept.

### Solving This Game

Would A actually offer that, though?

- In other words, are $x = p - k$ and $1 - x \ge 1 - p - k$ both true?

Recall: we just demonstrated $x = p + k$. From that, we can say  $1 - x \ge 1 - p - k$ by definition.

- The costs of war ($k$) are positive values to subtract from the utility of fighting a war.

### The Proof

What A would get (1 - *x*) must at least equal 1 - *k - p*. Therefore:

\begin{eqnarray}
1 - x &\ge& 1 - k - p     \nonumber \\
1 - 1 + k + p   &\ge& x \nonumber \\
p + k &\ge& x \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

### Solving This Game

We have just identified an equilibrium where two states agree to a pre-war solution over a contentious issue.

- There exists a bargaining space where A and B resolve their differences and avoid war.

###

![The Bargaining Space](bargaining-space.png)

## War as an Ultimatum Game
### War as an Ultimatum Game

If you know some game theory, this looks like an ultimatum game. It is.

### War as an Ultimatum Game

Assume you and I cannot agree how to split $100.

- I want all of it. So do you.
- For $20, we can set up a fight for $100.
    - First one to say "matté" (a la *Bloodsport*) loses.
- Assume *p* = .5, our EU(kumite) = (100)(.5) + (0)(.5) - 20 = 30

By itself, this is a fantastic lottery.

- For $20, you win $30 on average.
- We would agree to fight if this accurately represented our payoffs.

### War as an Ultimatum Game

Consider that I offer you a deal in light of this. I take $70; you take $30. Would you accept this?

- You might decry this as unequal. It is...

### War as an Ultimatum Game

However, if you were not permitted a counter-offer, you would accept this if you were rational.

- My offer to you just matched your expected utility of fighting.
- You would accept this, per our assumptions.
- Any offer I give to you between $30 and $70 would induce you to accept.
    - I would not offer you $70, though, because that'd be silly of me.
    
# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- War is the most destructive/costly thing we do.
    - Fortunately, it's a rare event.
- States mostly fight over the distribution of territory.
- Conceptually: war is bargaining failure.
    - We'll talk more next about why exactly bargaining fails.
