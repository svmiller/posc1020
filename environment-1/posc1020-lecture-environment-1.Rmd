# Collective Action and the Environment
### Collective Action and the Environment

Remember the prisoner's dilemma? The environment looks a lot like that.

- Mutual cooperation is the Pareto optimal outcome.
- Defection is the dominant strategy.
- Benefits are diffuse; costs are concentrated.
- Temptations to free-ride are real.

### Collective Action and the Environment

Environmental politics are unique in that our choices produce **externalities.**

- i.e. a cost/benefit to a third-party not involved in the choice.

If a country pumps CFCs/CO2 into the atmosphere, or a firm dumps waste into an important waterway, others bear those costs despite not being involved in the "transaction."

- Likewise, litter-pickup volunteers create an externality for their charity.

### The Environment as Public Good

Many environmental issues assume the form of public goods/public bads.

- Nonexcludable
- Nonrivalrous

These mostly arise from nature.

- i.e. we share one atmosphere, one climate, one ozone layer, etc...

## The Environment as Commons
### The Environment as Commons

The environment was an unregulated "common" for the longest time.

- Countries/actors were free to use/pollute as they saw fit.

Recent efforts have tried to rein this in:

- Kyoto Protocol (1997)
- Emissions Trading Scheme (2005)

### The Environment as Commons

However, these advancements have important limitations.

- Kyoto binds only those that have signed it.
    - Countries like Canada and Russia even opted out.
    - The U.S. signed the protocol but never ratified it.
- "Cap-and-trade" harnesses private incentives but it's not clear how cost-effective they are.
    - They further may not matter "overall."
    
### The Environment as Commons

Other environmental issues (prominently: fishing) involve **common-pool resources.**

- i.e. resources are non-excludable, but rivalrous.

Self-interested actors pursue conventions amid this problem.

- You'll notice: it's still a prisoner's dilemma.

## Solving Collective Action Problems
### Solving Collective Action Problems

Collective action problems are tough, but not impossible.

### The Importance of Group Size and Concentration

Collective action problems, like acid rain, are tractable in smaller groups and when externalities are concentrated.

- The costs of acid rain emissions fell largely on those that were the core of the problem.
- The actors involved were either isolated (e.g. US/Canada) or concentrated in Europe.
- LRTAP did well to address the problem of acid rain, at least in developed/Western countries.
    - China and India still have these problems, though.

### Solving the Prisoner's Dilemma

Same things that promote cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma help us understand cooperation on the environment.

- Iteration: repeated interaction raises costs associated with defection.
- Linkage: LRTAP was successful because it involved mutually dependent trading partners (e.g. US-Canada)

### Solving the Prisoner's Dilemma

It's useful to bundle public goods with private benefits.

- e.g. deforestation is usually linked with erosion control and ecotourism.
- e.g. DuPont and CFC bans.

Prisoner's dilemmas become tractable with the emergence of "privileged groups."

- i.e. why the U.S. and China are key actors on the future of environmental politics.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Environmental politics are a prisoner's dilemma.

- Cooperation is Pareto optimal but defection is dominant strategy.
- Costs get concentrated as benefits are diffuse.
- This takes peculiar forms when considering externalities and common-pool resources.

Prisoner's dilemmas are solvable, but still tricky.

- Important to link public goods with private benefits.
- The "dilemma" gets magnified the larger the group.
