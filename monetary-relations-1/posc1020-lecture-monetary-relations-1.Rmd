# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*I hear a lot about monetary relations and exchange rates. What are those and why do they matter?*

###

![Argentina in the midst of a severe wave of riots in Dec. 2001](arg-riots-2001.jpg)

### What Happened in Argentina?

Argentina seems like one of the most peaceful countries in the region. A timeline of what happened:

- Country had *severe* inflation problems.
    - Inflation even peaked at 3,000% in 1989.
- Corrections made largely came from Washington and included:
    - Convertibility Plan of 1991 that pegged peso 1-to-1 to USD.
    - Lower trade barriers, privatization of state-owned enterprises.
    
This made Argentina an attractive foreign market.

- Convertibility made international transactions easy.
- Also made it easier to borrow since loans were denominated in USD.

### What Happened in Argentina?

However, Argentina's fixed convertibility plan soon ran into a brick wall.

- Mexican peso crisis (1995) had an observable but contained effect.
- Currency crises in Asia/Brazil led to Brazil floating its currency.
    - This depreciated the real, helping Brazil, but hurting Argentina's producers.
- USD started to appreciate in value, raising Argentina's borrowing costs.

Convertibility (i.e. pegging peso to the dollar) facilitated Argentina's earlier recovery but it soon became a straitjacket.

### The Crisis in 2001

Argentina's depression starts in 1998 but it become a full crisis in 2001.

- Hundreds of thousands rioted in the streets, leaving dozens dead.
    - Rioters were mostly middle-class who found their debts/expenses (e.g. mortgages) were even more exorbitant.
- President resigned and was air-lifted from his palace to avoid being killed.
- Argentina defaulted on $93-billion in debts, the largest default in history.

### The Problem of Exchange Rates

The crisis has other factors (e.g. contagion, fiscal mismanagement, banking regulations) but its core is the problem of exchange rates.

# What Are Exchange Rates? Why Do They Matter?
### What Are Exchange Rates?

A national monetary system is a classic public good.

- Allows for convenient ability to exchange goods/services.
- Little incentive for private firms to provide it.

However, it exists in relation to other national currencies.

- The **exchange rate** is the price at which one currency is traded/exchanged for another.

### Appreciation and Depreciation

Exchange rates are variable.

- **Appreciation**: one currency increases in value relative to others.
- **Depreciation**: one currency decreases in value relative to others.

When we say Mexico's peso is depreciating, it means one U.S. dollar can buy more pesos.

- Alternatively: more pesos are required to buy a dollar.

       subtitle = "Mexico dropped its previous peg (i.e. three new pesos to one USD) in 1995, which you can see in the first few years of the data.")

```

## Determing Currency Values
### How Are Currency Values Determined?

Generally: through familiar laws of supply and demand.

- Of note here: the importance of interest rates.
- Higher interest rates = more demand to invest
- But, to invest, you need the national currency.

Central banks (e.g. the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) regulate exchange rates through various means.

- Raising or lowering interest rates
- Changing the quantity of money in circulation

### Allowing Exchange Rates to Vary

Two general strategies for exchange rates: to "fix" or "float."

- Fixed exchange rate: government commits to keep currency at or around specific value.
    - Nowadays: usually set against another currency. Historically: in gold (i.e. "gold standard")
- Floating exchange rate: currency changes at market value, more or less freely.

There are intermediate steps.

- Bretton Woods monetary system (1945-1973, "fixed but adjustable")

### Fixed Rate Regimes

Some fixed rate regimes are pegged to other currencies

- Bosnia (1 Bosnian mark = .5 euros, a la Dayton)
- Denmark (7 kroner = 1 euro)
- Saudi Arabia (1 USD = 3.75 riyals)

Others are on other national currencies.

- e.g. Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama all use U.S. dollars
 
## Who Cares About Exchange Rates?
### Who Cares About Exchange Rates?

Exchange rate policies create winners/losers. Each has tradeoffs for these actors.

1. Governments
2. Consumers/businesses

### Governments and Exchange Rates

Governments must balance multiple actors in adjusting exchange rates.

- Fixed currency provides stability, which makes investment easier.
- However, a government must commit itself to that exchange rate regime.
- This hamstrings a government's ability to respond to recessions.

Floating exchange rates give more flexibility, but also volatility.

### Consumers and Businesses

Even more difficulty follows in finding an ideal exchange rate in society. 

- A strong currency allows citizens to buy more.
- However, a strong currency puts producers at disadvantage with foreign competition.
- A weak currency makes national products more competitive.
- However, it makes consumers worse off and contributes to inflation.

There is no particular reason why one is better for a country overall.

### Consumers and Businesses

The exchange rate policies depend on the nature of the economy, interests groups, and the political system.

- In Europe: biggest cheerleaders for Euro came from smaller countries (e.g. BENELUX) and not the bigger ones (e.g. France, Italy)
- In Latin America: countries most indebted to U.S. trade pegged to or outright adopted the dollar.

In China: export-oriented economic planning led to overall renmibi devaluation to be competitive.

- However, this makes China's emerging middle class worse off.
- Related: China is presently pushing the value of the renmibi *up*, not *down*.

### An Aside: A Strong Dollar or Weak Dollar?

A weak dollar is useful if you're concerned about:

- Increasing exports
- Economic recovery amid downturns
- Current account imbalances

### An Aside: A Strong Dollar or Weak Dollar?

Some pitfalls of a weak dollar:

- Dollar's centrality in global finance requires faith in its value.
    - Without this, U.S. borrowing costs go up substantially.
- Weak dollars could lead to higher interest rates and raise borrowing costs.
    - i.e. it could actually slow economic recovery.
- Artificial depreciation could lead to reprisals/trade wars.

A strong dollar increases purchasing power and is arguably a critical American interest.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Monetary policy is an obtuse topic with important implications for your life.

- Wealthier/bigger states prefer some kind of flexibility in their monetary policy.
- Is a "strong" dollar better than a "weak" one? Depends on what you want.
