# Introduction
### Puzzle(s) for Today

*It's usually more rational to bargain than go to war, but is that true for "everyone" or just "states?"*

### War With Complete and Perfect Information

War generally never happens with complete and perfect information, except for:

1. Issue indivisibility
2. Asymmetric/incomplete information (i.e. uncertainty)
3. Commitment problems

# Domestic Politics and War
## Whose Interests Count?
### Domestic Politics and War

- Interests
- Leaders
- Groups

<!-- Interests may be national or particularistic. National security would be a national interest. Trade protection would be particularistic to the protected sector. Leaders and groups may have interests in war. -->

### Leaders and War

Do leaders ever spark war to keep power at home?

- Evidence is mixed, but we've seen it before.

How does the "rally around the flag" effect alter the bargaining range?

- A rally incentive increases the value of one side for war, decreasing size of bargaining range.

<!-- ### 

![What Rally Incentives Do to the Bargaining Range](fig43.png) -->

<!--

Rally Effects and the Bargaining Range



Rally effect: A short-term boost in government approval from a foreign policy crisis.
Both democratic and nondemocratic leaders may seek the rally effect:
	- 	rally for reelection
	- 	rally to reestablish legitimacy if nondemocratic

-->

### What Can We Say About "Rallies?"

The Falklands War is the classic case of the diversion and the rally.

- Diversion applies to domestic troubles for both sides.
- Rally applies to both sides as well.

However, general evidence in support of rallies and diversions are mixed.

- Generally, secure leaders are more likely to start a crisis.
- Most of our evidence is anecdotal.

###

![War, Especially a War Loss, is Particularly Costly to Democrat Leaders](fig4b.png) -->

### Domestic Groups and War

- War may serve the interests of some domestic groups.
- Groups may have selfish interests contrary to national interests.
- Different group types may have different vested interests.


### How Do Groups With Invested Interests Prevail?

Collective action 

- Smaller groups tend to be better organized. 
- Larger groups suffer from free riding.
- Groups may shape policy to support their narrow interests




### Domestic Groups and War

The military is the most important bureaucratic actor re: war.

- Has best information about capabilities and resolve.

We generally think military is too optimistic about war.

- Its purpose is to wage war.
- War leds to increased budgets and promotion opportunities.

This varies with key intuition: civilian leadership/oversight matters a lot.


### Domestic Groups and War

For simplicity's sake, war generally cleaves people into two groups.

- Hawks
- Doves

The prevalence of hawks generally shrinks the bargaining range for A and B.

- Like rally incentives: they increase value of war.

       title="The Proliferation of Democracies in the International System (1800-2016)")

```

### Institutions and War

Democratic institutions may discourage war.
	
- 	Forces consensus between elite and masses
- 	Leaders accountable	
- 	Masses bear costs
- 	Promotes norms of negotiation

The democratic process is slow, and leaves time for interstate bargaining. 

### Some Findings About the Democratic Peace

Mature liberal democracies do not fight each other. 

- They are also more transparent than other forms of government. 
- This helps actors overcome information problems that can lead to war. 
- This helps democracies avoid war with each other.

In nondemocratic states, a small group of leaders typically makes foreign policy behind closed doors.

- This limits what can be reported to the media and the public. 
- Lack of transparency can make it harder for foreign states to gauge the state’s capabilities and resolve.

Generally: democracies are peaceful with each other, but not other state types.


# Conclusion
### Conclusion

War may happen because domestic actors want it to happen.

- Narrow interests may push leaders to war.
- Diversionary and rally incentives are real.
  - Evidence for these hypotheses are weak relative to the anecdotes.
- Groups form around hawkish preferences.
- Hawkish interests are not sufficient to cause war on their own. 
- Free and fair elections, party competition, and free media can (but need not) dampen hawkish interests.


All have real implications for the bargaining between A and B in a crisis.
