# What Explains Development?
### What Explains Development?

1. Geography
2. Domestic factors
3. Domestic institutions

### Geography

Geography is less an argument for development and more a correlation. Factors include:

- Southern Hemisphere
- Landlocked territory
- Tropical weather/excessive heat

### Geography

There are intuitive arguments here, but geographical explanations mask substantial variation within cases.

- e.g. Chile and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere.
- Austria, Kazakhstan, and Switzerland are thriving landlocked countries.
- Oil states in the gulf and Sinagpore are hot/tropical and developed.

### Domestic Factors

Development follows important investment in infrastructure.

- Physical infrastructure
- Social infrastructure
- Property rights

Long-term growth requires a meaningful social investment.

### Domestic Factors

Sometimes key actors have no interest in that social investment.

- i.e. wealthy elites see these public goods as redistribution.
- Infrastructure may siphon cheap labor from the countryside.
- Actors motivated by race/ethnicity unlikely to see interest in common good.

### Domestic Institutions

Countries better endowed in natural resources generally have less incentive to promote meaningful development.

- We call this a "resource curse."

Intuition behind the "resource curse":

- States rich in primary commodities tend to generate most income from foreign receipts.
- This decreases incentive to innovate to improve productive capacities.

Recall our previous example of Northern Rhodesia/Zambia and South Korea.

# Are Rich Countries Responsible for LDCs?
## The Legacy of Colonialism
### Are Rich Countries Responsible for Problems in the Developing World?

Short answer: yes, that's an important part of it.



### The Legacy of Colonialism

Colonialism has an important legacy on development.

- Colonial powers were not interested in promoting meaningful development.
- Colonial powers were also not benign and "enlightening."

Colonialism is not a total explanation for LDC problems, but it's a real legacy.

### The Consequence for Not Meeting a Daily Rubber Quota in Belgian Congo

![The consequences of failing to meet a daily rubber quota in Belgian Congo, 1904](cong_hands_1904.jpg)

### Is the International Economy Biased Against LDCs?

Short answer: yes, that's part of it too.

## The Terms of Trade
### The Trade Bias Against LDCs

LDCs specialize in primary products like raw materials and agricultural goods.

- These markets are usually very competitive (e.g. coffee), which depresses prices.
- Bigger economies specialize in manufactured goods, which cluster on oligopolies. This raises prices.

Generally, the terms of trade works against LDCs.

- They get less for what they sell and pay more for what they buy.

## Institutional Biases
### Are Institutions Biased Against LDCs?

Short answer: yes, that an important part of the problem as well.

### The Institutional Bias Against LDCs

Bigger IGOs are dominated by richer countries.

- IMF, WB, and WTO all weight votes by economic size, and not population.
- The U.S. with just a little support from Europe, can veto any proposal in these IGOs it doesn't like.

       caption = "Data: International Monetary Fund")

```

### The Institutional Bias Against LDCs

International trade agreements have the same problem.

- Rich countries structure these to their advantage and also protect their industries (esp. agriculture) at the expense of poorer countries.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

Why are some countries rich and others poor?

- Correlates: poorer countries are landlocked, have tropical climates, and are in the Southern Hemisphere.
- Problem: these are noisy indicators at best, and don't explain much.
- Development hinges on domestic factors/institutions.
- Problem: these are also noisy and elites may not see an incentive in infrastructure.

Rich countries structured the world in their image.

- Colonial legacies, and fundamental economic/institutional biases all loom large.

<!--
# What Can LDCs Do About This Bias?

1. Import-substituting industrialization (ISI)
2. Export-oriented industrialization (EOI)
3. Commodity cartels

###

![Some countries, like Brazil, chose to cut off imports and protect/foster nascent industries](fnm-fabrica.jpg)

### The ISI Framework

- Enact trade barriers to shield industries from competition
- Subsidize modern industrial sector
- Invest in infrastructure to make industrialization possible.

Problems:

- Industries were inefficient
- Lack of competition usually meant products were low quality
- Uncompetitive exports compounded economic downturns

**Washington Consensus** to address ISI problems largely ended those policies.

###

![ISI products like the Yugo usually became punch-lines](yugo-00.jpg)

### The EOI Framework

Latin America generally turned inward. The "Asian Tigers" looked outward.

- Market products for quality for richer countries (esp. America)
- Depress currency to make exports cheap
- Extend low-interest loans and tax breaks to exporters toward that end.

### Commodity Cartels

Poorer countries sharing common resource have found cartels useful

- OPEC is clearly best example of this.

However, commodity cartels are no quick fix.

- Cartels are hard to govern!
- Oil is a unique commodity too.

# Conclusion
### Conclusion

- While everyone prefers development, powerful groups can block it.
- Domestic institutions play an important role—they may promote or hinder development.
- Rich countries adopt policies that hurt the poor.
- Successful development requires a country to overcome both internal and external obstacles. -->
